# SIGA System - Production Security Cleanup & Optimization Report

## Executive Summary

The SIGA system has undergone comprehensive security cleanup and optimization to ensure production readiness. All security measures are now properly integrated, optimized for performance, and free from development artifacts that could pose security risks.

## Completed Security Cleanup Actions

### 1. Removed Test & Debug Files ‚úÖ
**Critical Priority**

The following development/test files have been removed from production:
- `phpinfo.php` - Security risk (exposed server information)
- `teste_envio_excel.php` - Test file
- `validation_test.php` - Validation testing script  
- `security_test.php` - Security testing script
- `security_test_suite.php` - Complete test suite
- `test_database_connection.php` - Database connection test
- `system_verification_test.php` - System verification test
- `diagnostic_check.php` - Diagnostic utilities
- `credit_integration_example.php` - Example/demo file
- `security_usage_examples.php` - Usage examples

**Impact**: Eliminates information disclosure risks and reduces attack surface.

### 2. Consolidated Session Configuration ‚úÖ
**Critical Priority**

Replaced multiple conflicting session configuration files with a single, optimized production configuration:

**Old Files (moved to backup):**
- `session_config.php` (complex, development-oriented)
- `simple_session_config.php` (basic fallback)

**New File:**
- `production_session_config.php` - Single source of truth with:
  - 30-minute session timeout
  - 5-minute ID regeneration  
  - Session hijacking detection
  - Secure cookie configuration
  - Production error handling
  - Comprehensive logging

**Impact**: Eliminates configuration conflicts and ensures consistent security policy.

### 3. Cleaned Up Error Reporting & Debug Code ‚úÖ
**Critical Priority**

Modified `config.php` to use production-safe error handling:

**Before:**
```php
// TEMPOR√ÅRIO: Mostrar erros para debug
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', 1);
```

**After:**
```php
// Production error handling
$is_production = true;
error_reporting(E_ALL & ~E_NOTICE & ~E_DEPRECATED & ~E_STRICT);
ini_set('display_errors', 0);
ini_set('log_errors', 1);
```

**Impact**: Prevents information disclosure while maintaining proper error logging.

### 4. Optimized Security Functions ‚úÖ
**Medium Priority**

Enhanced `security_functions.php` for production use:
- Improved performance of logging functions
- Enhanced security header management  
- Optimized XSS detection middleware
- Production-safe error handling
- Reduced log verbosity for performance

**Impact**: Better performance with maintained security coverage.

### 5. Created Master Production Security Configuration ‚úÖ
**Critical Priority**

Developed `production_security_config.php` as the central security configuration:

**Features:**
- Consolidated all security settings
- Production-optimized error handling
- Advanced security headers (HSTS, CSP, etc.)
- Automatic security logging setup
- Security health monitoring
- Performance-optimized policies

**Impact**: Single source of truth for all security configurations.

### 6. Set CSP to Enforcement Mode ‚úÖ
**Medium Priority**

Updated Content Security Policy for production:

**Changes:**
- `csp_config.json`: Changed `"report_only": false`
- `header.php`: Set `$REPORT_ONLY_MODE = false`
- Added production-specific CSP policies
- Enhanced violation logging

**Impact**: Active protection against XSS attacks instead of just monitoring.

### 7. Removed Redundant Security Files ‚úÖ
**Medium Priority**

Moved overlapping/redundant files to backup directory:
- `security_config_monitor.php` - Overlapped with dashboard
- `security_monitoring.php` - Duplicate functionality  
- `security_forensics.php` - Not needed in production
- `security_response.php` - Advanced feature, not essential
- `security_alerts.php` - Consolidated into main system
- `security_api.php` - Advanced API, not needed for basic production
- `security_reports.php` - Reporting moved to dashboard

**Kept Essential Files:**
- `security_functions.php` - Core security functions
- `security_dashboard.php` - Admin monitoring interface
- `advanced_security_system.php` - Advanced CSP system
- `hybrid_auth.php` - Authentication system

**Impact**: Cleaner codebase, reduced complexity, easier maintenance.

### 8. Optimized Security Headers ‚úÖ  
**Medium Priority**

Implemented production-optimized security headers in `production_security_config.php`:

**Headers Applied:**
- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`  
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (for HTTPS)
- `Content-Security-Policy` (comprehensive)
- `Cache-Control` (for sensitive pages)

**Impact**: Comprehensive protection against common web vulnerabilities.

### 9. Organized Documentation ‚úÖ
**Low Priority**

Moved all documentation files to structured directory:
- Created `docs/security/` directory
- Moved all `.md` files to appropriate location
- Organized security documentation

**Impact**: Cleaner root directory, better documentation organization.

### 10. Created Production Verification Script ‚úÖ
**Medium Priority**

Developed `production_security_check.php` for ongoing verification:

**Capabilities:**
- Comprehensive security configuration checks
- File permission verification  
- Session security validation
- Error handling verification
- CSP configuration validation
- PHP security settings check
- Production readiness assessment
- Automated health monitoring

**Impact**: Ongoing verification of security posture and production readiness.
